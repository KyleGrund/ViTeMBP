Video Telemetry for Mountain Biking Platform

This repository contains the embedded system and web service back-end portions of the ViTeMBP project.

ViTeMBP is an IoT telemetry system implemented on a mountain bike, which can overlay sensor data with time synchronized video footage to create a final video that can provide the user with quantified sensor data on both bike and rider performance.
